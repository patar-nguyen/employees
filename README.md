# Employees

A simple CRUD application using the PERN (Postgresql, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. User can create, edit, and delete employees. 

## Dependencies
- React
- Psql
- Express
- Cors
- Pg

## Backend & Database
I first started off by creating the database for the application using PostgreSQL. I created a database for the employees and a table to store each individual employee and their respective information. 
Express is used to create the server and cors is used as the middleware to connect client to server side. I then created the routes to retrieve all employees/specific employee, update an employee, and delete and employee. 

## Frontend
The front end of the application was created using React and Bootstrap. Bootstrap was used to create the tables, buttons, and to make everything look more appealing and user friendly. The application consisted of three components, adding an employee, editing and employee, and displaying/deleting an employee.
